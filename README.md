    ui/                 Small reusable primitives
      Button.tsx
      SectionLabel.tsx  Numbered eyebrow used at the top of each section
  data/
    site.ts             All copy/content as typed arrays — edit here, not in components
  types/
    index.ts            Shared TypeScript interfaces for the content above
public/
  images/               Drop real photography/renders here (see Images below)
```

## Why it's split this way

- **One component per section** so each block from the Figma maps 1:1 to a file — easy to find, easy to hand off.
- **`data/site.ts`** holds all text/labels/prices as data, not hardcoded JSX — swap in real copy or wire up a CMS later without touching layout code.
- **`ui/`** holds only the two primitives reused everywhere (buttons, the numbered section eyebrow) to keep the visual language consistent.

## Video / slider sections

Per your note, the hero media and the "Life Changing Experiences" block are left as clearly marked placeholder slots (`Hero.tsx`, `ExperienceCarousel.tsx`, `VideoExperience.tsx`) — drop in your slider library or video player there. Everything else matches the reference design.

## Images

All imagery is currently a styled placeholder `div` (`bg-surface border border-border`) so the layout is verifiable without assets. To wire in real images:

1. Add files to `public/images/` (paths already referenced in `src/data/site.ts`, e.g. `/images/category-home.jpg`).
2. Replace the placeholder `<div>` in the relevant section component with Next.js `<Image src={...} alt={...} fill />` inside a `relative` wrapper.

## Fonts

The build in this sandbox has no internet access, so `next/font/google` (Playfair Display + Inter) was swapped for system-font fallbacks in `globals.css`. To restore the intended luxury serif/sans pairing, re-add in `layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Playfair_Display, Inter } from "next/font/google";
```

and reference `--font-playfair` / `--font-inter` in `globals.css` once you have normal network access.
